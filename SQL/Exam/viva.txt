Here are short, viva-ready answers on all important DBMS keys. Keep them crisp and to the point 👇

1. Super Key

A super key is a set of one or more attributes that uniquely identifies a record in a table.

2. Candidate Key

A candidate key is a minimal super key; no attribute can be removed and still uniquely identify a record.

3. Primary Key

A primary key is the candidate key chosen to uniquely identify each row in a table.
It cannot be NULL or duplicated.

4. Alternate Key

An alternate key is a candidate key that is not selected as the primary key.

5. Foreign Key

A foreign key is an attribute in one table that refers to the primary key of another table, used to maintain referential integrity.

6. Composite Key

A composite key is a key formed using two or more attributes together to uniquely identify a record.

7. Unique Key

A unique key ensures that all values in a column are unique, but it can allow NULL values.

8. Natural Key

A natural key is a key formed from real-world data, like Email ID or Aadhaar number.

9. Surrogate Key

A surrogate key is an artificially created key, usually an auto-increment ID, with no business meaning.

10. Secondary Key

A secondary key is used for searching and retrieval, not for unique identification.

11. Partial Key

A partial key uniquely identifies weak entities along with a foreign key of a strong entity.

12. Primary Key vs Foreign Key (1-line)

Primary key uniquely identifies records in a table, while foreign key creates a relationship between tables.

13. Candidate Key vs Primary Key

A table can have multiple candidate keys, but only one primary key.

14. Can a table have multiple primary keys?

No, a table can have only one primary key, but it may be composite.

15. Can a foreign key be NULL?

Yes, unless restricted by constraints.

Here is a simple, short, and viva-ready explanation of DDL, DML, and other SQL commands with easy examples 👇

1. DDL (Data Definition Language)

Used to create and modify database structure.

Commands: CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE

2. DML (Data Manipulation Language)

Used to insert, update, and delete data.

Commands: INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE

3. DQL (Data Query Language)

Used to fetch data from database.

Command: SELECT

4. DCL (Data Control Language)

Used to give or remove permissions.

Commands: GRANT, REVOKE

5. TCL (Transaction Control Language)

Used to manage transactions.

Commands: COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT

One-Line Difference (for Viva)

DDL → Structure

DML → Data

DQL → Query

DCL → Permission

TCL → Transaction

What is JOIN?

A JOIN is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column.

1. INNER JOIN

Returns only matching records from both tables.

2. LEFT JOIN (LEFT OUTER JOIN)

Returns all records from left table and matching records from right table.

3. RIGHT JOIN (RIGHT OUTER JOIN)

Returns all records from right table and matching records from left table.

4. FULL JOIN (FULL OUTER JOIN)

Returns all records from both tables, matched or not.

5. CROSS JOIN

Returns all possible combinations of rows.

6. SELF JOIN

A table joined with itself.

One-Line Summary (Viva Tip)

INNER → matching rows

LEFT → all left + matching right

RIGHT → all right + matching left

FULL → all records

CROSS → combinations

SELF → same table
